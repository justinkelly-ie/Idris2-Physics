||| An Applicative Homomorphism natural transformation morphing applicative context `f` to `g`.
||| Preserves `pure` and application `(<*>)` across scale and state domain transformations.
public export
interface (Applicative f, Applicative g) => ApplicativeHomomorphism (0 f : Type -> Type) (0 g : Type -> Type) where
  ||| The underlying natural transformation
  morph : {0 a : Type} -> f a -> g a

  ||| Proof 1: Pure preservation law: morph (pure x) === pure x
  0 purePreserved : {0 a : Type} -> (x : a) -> morph (pure {f} x) = pure {f=g} x

  ||| Proof 2: Application preservation law: morph (h <*> x) === morph h <*> morph x
  0 appPreserved : {0 a, b : Type} -> (h : f (a -> b)) -> (x : f a) -> morph (h <*> x) = morph h <*> morph x
